In this interactive circular graph visualization, model elements identified as important by the Council (through risk assessment) and by the working group (through a range of experience and expertise) are at the perimeter of the circle. Elements are defined in detail in the last section of [this page](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html). Relationships between elements are represented as links across the center of the circle to other elements on the perimeter. Links from a model element that affect another element start wide at the base and are color coded to match the category of the element they affect.Hover over a perimeter section (an element) to see all relationships for that element, including links from other elements. Hover over a link to see what it connects. Links by default show text for the two elements and the direction of the relationship (1 for relationship, 0 for no relationship--most links are one direction).For example, hovering over the element "Total Landings" in the full model shows that the working group identified the elements affected by landings as Seafood Production, Recreational Value, and Commercial Profits (three links leading out from landings), and the elements affecting landings as Fluke SSB, Fluke Distributional Shift, Risk Buffering, Management Control, Total Discards, and Shoreside Support (6 links leading into Total Landings).

# Ease of customization for alternate needs

[Presentation of the results of the work group to the MAFMC used different visual representation of the conceptual model](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_final_2col.html)

Allowed work group to walk through top 3 questions with visual representation to discuss relevant ecosystem linkages.

FYI - the Council chose question 3 to develop a Management Strategy Evaluation around. Work is currently underway.

# In Conclusion...

R can greatly facilitate conceptual modeling:

- Recurring, changing needs

- Striking visualizations

- Interactivity

???
---
# Council moved forward with the MSE, however...

- Some stakeholder confusion surrounding conceptual modeling

  + Differing levels of engagement

- Chord Diagram can be polarizing

  + All horrendograms are horrendous
  
  + Could be pre-tested
